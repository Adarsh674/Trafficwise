# **App Name**: TrafficAI Insights

## Core Features:

- Algorithm Comparison Charts: Display charts comparing DQN, PPO, and MARL algorithms' performance in traffic signal control.
- Performance Metrics Display: Present performance metrics such as average wait time, throughput, and congestion levels for each algorithm.
- Algorithm Summary Report: Generate a summary report that compares and contrasts the algorithms. The summary will note relative strengths and weaknesses. The LLM will use a tool to decide which metrics are most useful for a summary.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) to represent traffic flow and efficiency.
- Secondary colors: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for backgrounds and darker gray (#A9A9A9) for text.
- Accent: Orange (#FFA500) to highlight important metrics and interactive elements.
- Use clear and readable fonts to display data labels, titles, and descriptions.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different metrics and algorithms.
- Use a clean and organized layout to present charts and data in an easily understandable format.
- Subtle animations to transition between charts and data views.

## Original User Request:
create a web app that displays the comparison of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) algorithms in AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) using charts and plots.
